# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 14, 2026**

## Introduction
Thank you for using **GoTo**. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how GoTo handles information when you use our browser extension.

## Data Handling and Privacy
GoTo is designed with a "privacy-first" approach. We believe that your browsing data belongs to you.
- **Local Processing**: All search operations for your Tabs, Bookmarks, and History are performed locally on your device. 
- **No Data Collection**: We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data, browsing history, bookmarks, or search queries to any external servers.
- **No Tracking**: We do not use any analytics, tracking pixels, or cookies to monitor your behavior.

## Permissions Explained
To provide its core functionality, GoTo requires the following permissions:
- **Tabs**: Used to search through your currently open tabs and switch between them.
- **History**: Used to allow you to search through your browsing history for quick access to previously visited sites.
- **Bookmarks**: Used to search through your saved bookmarks.
- **Storage**: Used to save your personal preferences (such as your preferred language, result limits, and theme settings) locally in your browser.
- **Context Menus**: Used to provide quick access to GoTo features via the right-click menu.

## Data Storage
Any configuration or settings you choose within GoTo are stored locally on your machine using the browser's synchronized storage API. This data is only used to maintain your user experience across your own devices where you have synced your browser profile.

## Third-Party Services
GoTo does not share any information with third-party services. The extension functions entirely within your browser environment.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the extension after changes are made constitutes your acceptance of the new Privacy Policy.
